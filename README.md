This project was forked in order to test it using ArchUnit. The file README.md contains the documentation of the original project.

With this project we want to show how to use ArchUnit to test some architectural feature of a Java Project. Some of these are preimplemented in the ArchUnit API, some other have been implemented from scratch.

All test classes concerning the architectural level are located in src/test/java/alexp/blog/arch.
